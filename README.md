# ML-AI-Data

It's important to start out with a single question:

*What is Data Literacy*
  - How well we...
                - Read Data
                - Interpret Data
                - Communicate Data

How does data literacy factor in? Part of understanding and communicating with data means asking the right questions so that we end up with useful, relevant data.


Asking the following questions:
Do we have sufficient data to answer the question at hand?
Can my data answer my exact question?
Who participated in the data?
Who is left out? Why?
Who made the data?

In order to be a good machine learning programmer, we need to know what Statistics is and how they help us do our job:

### Story Time: The Importance of Data
The Challenger space shuttle carried seven US astronauts who were supposed to deploy a satellite and study Halley’s Comet while they were in orbit. Less than two minutes after takeoff, however, the shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.
The explosion was caused by a failure of two O-rings: small rubber rings that helped create an airtight seal between the space shuttle and its launch fuel supply. Before the launch, engineers were concerned about how the low-temperature forecast would affect the O-rings’ ability to make a proper seal.
The engineers made their arguments in favor of postponing the launch using, in part, a series of data visualizations that showed launch success rates at various temperatures. Tragically, their arguments did not prevent the launch from proceeding.

Data tells stories. Sometimes those stories can be good, sometimes they can be bad. The difference exists the results that data gives us, and the data we get can either help us tremendously or harm us significantly. 


Garbage in, garbage out is a data-world phrase that means “our data-driven conclusions are only as strong, robust, and well-supported as the data behind them.”

For example: we have a lot of data on heart attacks, but there’s room for improvement when it comes to data quality. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, but as of 2021, women account for only 38% of participants in relevant research studies.

There are key differences between men’s and women’s heart attacks that impact how they’re treated, but our data doesn’t yet adequately outline those differences. This leads ultimately to worse outcomes in treatment and a higher post-heart attack mortality rate for women.

## The Objective of ML
To teach computers to learn patterns from reading data. (What patterns can they see?)
  - and from those patterns what guesses can we make?

## What is a Model?
A model is a representation of what data represents.
